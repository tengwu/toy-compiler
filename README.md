# README
This is a concise README file.

This repository is a fork from jeremyxu2010/toy-compiler. I have adapted it to work with LLVM 16.0.0.

I have only added the feature of if-elseif-else statement to it at the moment. Please note that this repository is still under active development, and I anticipate that it will require significant time and effort to complete.

For more information, please refer to [my blog](https://tengwu.github.io/2023/04/02/writing-a-compiler-with-open-source-tools/).
