* README
This is a concise README file.

This repository is a fork from [[https://github.com/jeremyxu2010/toy-compiler][jeremyxu2010/toy-compiler]]. I have adapted it to work with LLVM 16.0.0.

I have only added the features of =branch-statement= and =while-loop= to it at the moment. Please note that this repository is still under active development, and I anticipate that it will require significant time and effort to complete.

For more information, please refer to [my blog](https://tengwu.github.io/2023/04/02/writing-a-compiler-with-open-source-tools/).
